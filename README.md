# README for `bill-ion/tikzjax`
This fork is based on the `develop` branch of [`benrbray/tikzjax`](https://github.com/benrbray/tikzjax/tree/develop). 

A live demo for this fork is at https://bill-ion.github.io/tikzjax-live/.

# README for `benrbray/tikzjax`

My fork is based on the `output-single-file` branch of [`artisticat1/tikzjax`](https://github.com/artisticat1/tikzjax/tree/ba892f23a2d280d018681a4f88b39f5a8648c7c7), which itself is a fork of [`drgrice1/tikzjax`](https://github.com/drgrice1/tikzjax/tree/ww-modifications), which itself is a fork of [`kisonecat/tikzjax`](https://github.com/kisonecat/tikzjax).  To `artisticat1`'s fork, I have added:

* [x] fixed build issues with changes to `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` 
* [x] a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` which allow for reproducible builds of `tikzjax` via a Docker image that installs all required dependencies and runs the build scripts for both `tikzjax` and `web2js`
* [x] a `build_tikzjax.sh` which starts the Docker container and extracts the resulting output files

In the future, I hope to make the following improvements:

* [ ] include some basic basic symbols & packages which are currently missing, for example `\ulcorner` and `\lrcorner` for commutative diagrams
* [ ] make it easier to include custom `*.sty` files, such as `quiver.sty` from [q.uiver.app](https://q.uiver.app/)
* [ ] add a way to disable the automatic detection of `<script type="tikz">` elements, and instead manually invoke the `tikzjax` renderer, for more control
* [ ] add a way to disable caching of rendered tikzjax elements, for development purposes
* [ ] add a way to override the default loading spinner
* [ ] rather than printing TeX rendering errors to the console, allow the user to pass in a custom handler for console output.  This would make it possible to display any TeX errors on the page itself, rather than just in the console.
* [ ] simplify the build process and update dependencies
* [ ] release my fork as an `npm` package for easier integration with other projects

## Use TikzJax

The `output` folder contains all the files you need to use TikzJax:

* `output/tikzjax.js`
* `output/fonts.css`

Simply include these on your page, and any `<script type="text/tikz">` element will be automatically detect and rendered with `tikzjax`.  

```html
<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[very thin,color=gray] (-0.1,-1.1) grid (3.9,3.9);
    \draw[->] (-0.2,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right] {$x$};
    \draw[->] (0,-1.2) -- (0,4.2) node[above] {$f(x)$};
    \draw[color=red]    plot (\x,\x)             node[right] {$f(x) =x$};
    \draw[color=blue]   plot (\x,{sin(\x r)})    node[right] {$f(x) = \sin x$};
    \draw[color=orange] plot (\x,{0.05*exp(\x)}) node[right] {$f(x) = \frac{1}{20} \mathrm e^x$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
</script>
```

For more examples, see the (`artisticat1/obsidian-tikzjax`](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-tikzjax) repository.

## Build TikzJax

In the root folder, simply run `bash build_tikzjax.sh`, which takes the following steps:

1. Re-builds the Docker image, installing all necessary dependencies, and running the build scripts for both `web2js` and `tikzjax`.
2. Starts the Docker container and extracts the `tikzjax.js` and `fonts.css` files produced by `tikzjax`. 
3. Stops the container.

After running the script, check `./output` for the output files.

## Manual Build

To rebuild the image and run a new container in detached mode:

```bash
$ docker compose up --build -d
```

In the container, the output of `tikzjax` can be found under `/code/tikzjax/dist`.  To copy it to your local machine, run:

```bash
$ mkdir -p output
$ docker compose cp develop:/code/tikzjax/dist/fonts.css ./output
$ docker compose cp develop:/code/tikzjax/dist/tikzjax.js ./output
```

Or, if you instead want to open a new shell inside the container:

```bash
$ docker compose exec develop bash
```

This is useful for debugging any issues with the build process.

## Development Tips

* If you prefer to develop locally, rather than through Docker, you can use the `Dockerfile` as a guide to install the required dependencies.

# README for `aristicat1/tikzjax`

TikZJax converts `<script>` tags (containing TikZ code) into SVGs.

See a live demo at http://tikzjax.com/

Note that the demo above is not the same as what you will get from what this branch of my
fork.  However, it does show the general concept.

Thanks to Jim Fowler for doing all of the hard work.  See
https://github.com/kisonecat/tikzjax, https://github.com/kisonecat/web2js, and
https://github.com/kisonecat/dvi2html for his original work.

Also see https://github.com/jhoobergs/web2js and https://github.com/jhoobergs/web2js for
additional changes that were made by Jesse Hoobergs that were used in this work.

## Example

In the `<head>` of your HTML, include
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http[s]://<path to dist contents>/fonts.css">
<script src="http[s]://<path to dist contents>/tikzjax.js"></script>
```
(See [Deployment](#deployment) below.)

Then in the `<body>`, include TikZ code such as
```html
<script type="text/tikz">
    \draw (0,0) circle (1in);
</script>
```

The TikZ code will be compiled into an SVG image, and the `<script>` element will be
replaced with the generated SVG image.

## How does this work?

Using the ww-modifications branch of https://github.com/drgrice1/web2js the Pascal source
of `TeX` is compiled to WebAssembly, and the `LaTeX` format is loaded (without all the
hyphenation data). Then
```tex
\documentclass[margin=0pt]{standalone}
\def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-ximera.def}
\usepackage[svgnames]{xcolor}
\usepackage{tikz}
```
is executed.  Then the core is dumped and compressed.  The WebAssembly and core are loaded
in the browser and executed.  An SVG driver for PGF along in the ww-modifications branch
of https://github.com/drgrice1/dvi2html are then utilized to convert the DVI output into
to an SVG image.

All of this happens in the browser.

Note that TeX will only be run the first time that a "text/tikz" script tag appears in a
page.  After that run of TeX, the SVG image will be cached, and the next time the same
"text/tikz" script appears the cached SVG image will be loaded.  If the text content of
the script tag or any of the `data` attributes (described below) are changed, then TeX
will be run again to update the image.

## Options

There are several data attributes that can be set for a "text/tikz" `<script>` tag that
affect the generation of the resulting SVG image, or change the way the TikzJax
javascript behaves.

The values of the `data-width` and `data-height` attributes set on the `<script>` tag
will be used for the width and height of a loader image.  This is an svg image that is
displayed while TeX is being run to generate the svg image, and contains a spinner to
indicate to the user that work is being done.  These dimensions are in points.

Use `data-tex-packages` to load and use TeX packages.  The value of this attribute must
be a string that will parse to a valid javascript object via the javascript JSON.parse
method.  The keys of the object should be the TeX package names, and the value of each
key should be the package options to set.
For example:
```html
<script type="text/tikz" data-tex-packages="custom-package"
	data-tex-package='{"pgfplots":"","custom-package":"option=special"}'>
```
will add
```tex
\usepackage{array}\usepackage{pgfplots}
\usepackage[option=special]{custom-package}
```
to the preamble of the TeX input.  Note that TeX packages must be loaded in this way.
This will ensure that the needed TeX system files are made available to the TeX
WebAssembly for successful compilation.  Note that the only TeX packages that are
available at this time are `array`, `pgfplots`, and `tikz-3dplot`.  Additional packages
can be made available by adding a file `<package-name>.json` that contains an array of
file names needed by the package to the `tex_packages` directory, and adding the gzipped
files in that array to the `tex_files` directory.

Use `data-tikz-libraries` to load and use TikZ libraries.
For example:
```html
<script type="text/tikz" data-tikz-libraries="arrows.meta,calc">
```
will result in
```tex
\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta,calc}
```
being added to the preamble of the TeX input.  As with TeX packages, TikZ libraries must
be loaded in this way to ensure that the needed TeX system files are made available to the
TeX WebAssembly for successful compilation.  Note that all known TikZ libraries are
available (with the exception of some that don't make sense in this context, like the
external library).

Use `data-add-to-preamble="..."` to add to the TeX preamble.

Use `data-show-console="true"` to enable the output of TeX in the console.  By default,
console output is disabled and nothing is shown in the browser console.  If this data
attribute is set, then you will see
```text
This is e-TeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6 (preloaded format=latex 1776.7.4)
**entering extended mode
(input.tex
LaTeX2e <2020-02-02> patch level 2
...
Transcript written on input.log.
```
output to the console.  This is useful when testing your TikZ code to ensure that it
compiles successfully, but should be left disabled for production.

## CSS Classes

For your convenience, some css classes are provided that will apply common styles to the
svg image.  To use these classes place the "text/tikz" script tags inside an html element
with one of the following classes.

If you add the css class `tikzjax-container` to the containing element, then
`overflow:visible` will be added to the style of the generated `<svg>` image.

If you add the css class `tikzjax-scaled-container` to the containing element, then
`overflow:visible`, `width:100%`, and `height:100%` will be added to the style of the
generated `<svg>` image.

## Other JavaScript Interactions

Note that once tikzjax completes the generation of an SVG image, the generated `<svg>`
image will emit the `tikzjax-load-finished` event.  You can use this event to do
something with the generated SVG image in javascript.

For example:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('tikzjax-load-finished', function(e) {
	var svg = e.srcElement;
	...
});
```

## Building

First clone this GitHub repository (https://github.com/drgrice1/tikzjax) and switch to the
ww-modifications branch.

Then clone my fork of web2js (https://github.com/drgrice1/web2js) and also switch to
the ww-modifications branch.  Follow the directions in the README for a "quick path to
generate the tex.wasm and core.dump files".  Then copy the generated core.dump and
tex.wasm files to the tikzjax directory, and gzip them.

Finally run
```
npm install
npm run build
```
in the tikzjax directory to build the tikzjax distribution.  Note that in order for this
full build to be successful you must have a TeX distribution installed with the
necessary TeX and TikZ files available and locatable by `kpsewhich`.

# Deployment
The `dist` directory that is generated by the build process above will contain everything
needed.  Copy the contents to your server for deployment.  To use it in a webpage add
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http[s]://<path to dist contents>/fonts.css">
<script src="http[s]://<path to dist contents>/tikzjax.js"></script>
```
to the html page.  Of course use `http:` or `https:` instead of `http[s]:` (or remove that
entirely for a protocol agnostic approach) and adjust `<path to dist contents>` as needed.
